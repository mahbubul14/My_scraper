# RUBY CAPSTONE: MY_SCRAPER

In this project, I was asked to use ruby for scraping websites and to get information. I decided to get info on NIKE products from https://www.nike.com/w/mens-nike-by-you-lifestyle-shoes-13jrmz6ealhznik1zy7ok. The project is capable of getting the information right from your terminal. You can view available products and their prices whenever you need
